- Design the main application logic (e.g., in `src/listener.py` or similar) to orchestrate the sequence of processing steps.
- Implement comprehensive error handling at each stage of the pipeline.
- Use custom error utilities (e.g., `src/utils_error.py`) and clear logging to track progress and diagnose issues.
- Ensure idempotent behavior where appropriate, or clear mechanisms for reprocessing failed items.
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks, especially in I/O operations (downloads, file access) and model inference.
