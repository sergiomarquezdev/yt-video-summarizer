- **Core Framework**: Use PyTorch as the primary framework for loading and running ML models.
- Utilize setup scripts (e.g., in `setup/`) to download and organize pre-trained models (e.g., in `models/`).
- For ML models, ensure efficient use of GPU resources if available.
- Key Dependencies: `torch`, `torchaudio`
