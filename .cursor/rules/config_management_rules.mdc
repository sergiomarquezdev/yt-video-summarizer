- Utilize JSON configuration files (e.g., `config/settings.json`) for managing:
    - Model paths and versions.
    - API keys and endpoints (e.g., Azure OpenAI).
    - Processing thresholds (e.g., VAD sensitivity, confidence scores).
    - Pub/Sub topic and subscription IDs.
    - Database connection details.
- Rely on external configuration files (JSON) for adaptable parameters.
- Key Dependencies: `python-dotenv` (for environment variable management, often used with config)
